> Hi Scrimbassadors! Here’s a GitHub Profile README template you can use as a starting point to make your Github profile more fun and informative.
>
> A profile "README” is a special repository named exactly the same as your GitHub username. The `README.md` from that repo appears at the top of your GitHub profile, so you can add a short bio, highlight projects, share additional links and whatever else you like. This is just a base template we recommend styling it however you please, so get creative!
>
> If you’re new to this, GitHub’s official guide (what it is + how to set it up) is here:
> https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/profile-customization/managing-your-profile-readme.
